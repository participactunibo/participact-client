#_ParticipAct-client_

##README
ParticipAct is a project by University of Bologna 
aimed at studying the still under-explored potential of collaboration among people 
exploiting smartphones as interaction tool and interconnection medium.

We developed a smartphone application that allows users to easily do coordinated tasks 
(for example, to automatically collect data about network coverage or about audio pollution) 
and sends collected data to our platform that process, aggregates and analyzes the data, 
thus extracting information that could not be possibly be obtained by a single user.

Data gathered are already a lot. On this site are available some information on what we realized 
thanks to help of many students.
